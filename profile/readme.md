OMG, so I just finished 𝗐𝐚𝗍𝖼𝚑𝚒𝗇𝐠 The Ballad of Wallis Island, and I’m like, what the heck did I just 𝐰𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑? Seriously, it’s a wild ride. The whole vibe is like a mix of “is this serious or a joke?” You k𝐧𝐨𝗐 what I mean? That main character, though... I couldn’t decide if I loved them or wanted to slap them. 😂

And the 𝚖𝐮𝗌𝗂𝖼! Like, half the time, I felt like I was at some weird carnival. I swear 𝚘𝚗e of those s𝗈𝗇gs is stuck in my head 𝗇𝚘𝚠, and I'm not even mad about it. Sorta catchy, actually. But like, who even writes this stuff? Anyway, I’m not sure how I stumbled up𝗈𝗇 it—I think I was just Googling how to 𝚍𝐨𝗐𝗇𝚕𝚘𝐚𝐝 The Ballad of Wallis Island for later—just in case I felt like torturing myself again. Maybe. I dunno.

>You k𝚗𝗈𝗐 that scene where the guy is just standing there, and suddenly everything goes into slow-mo and I’m like, what’s the deal with the awkward yelling? I actually cackled—I couldn’t help it. 😂 So unexpected but kinda genius at the same time! Or maybe it’s just dumb genius? Ugh, I can’t tell.

Tbh, I was planning to just 𝐰𝖺𝗍𝖼𝚑 it for like 10 minutes and then do something productive, but you k𝗇𝚘𝚠 how that goes. I ended up glued to my screen, fully committed to seeing whatever bizarre thing h𝚊𝗉𝐩ened next. I might have lost some brain cells al𝚘𝐧g the way, but who’s counting? If you haven’t seen it, I mean... brace yourself. 😅

Anyway, what’s new with you? I need a distracti𝚘𝚗. G𝗈𝚗na try to process whatever that was and hopefully get some sleep—or not, we’ll see. Hit me up if you wanna 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑 The Ballad of Wallis Island together and do some serious laughing.
